    				<h2>
    					About Me
    				</h2>
    					<li>
    						I'm a veterinary Assistant, and a Canine Specialist. I'm currently working on my Master Grooming and I'm hoping to have my own business when I get out. I'm from a small town in Maine but traveled doing Rodeos so I have seen alot places.
    					</li>
    				<h2>
    					Why am I participating in this Brave Course?
    				</h2>	
    					<li>
    						To gain knowledge into the computer world and to be able to design a web page when it comes time to open my own business. I want to be able to promate myself and share my qualities with others as well as keep people up to date with new training techniques and up to date supplies.
						</li>
					<h2>
						What do I hope to get out of this course?
					</h2>
						<li>
    						I want to know how to build a web page and work with computers, in hopes that when I own my own business I will be able to do things on my own and not have to have others do things for me.
    					</li>
    				<h2>
    					Who am I inspired by?
    				</h2>
    					<li>
							My brother who is battling cancer right now and has managed to stand tall he is a veteran and has 2 small kids that he continues to fight the battle of life hard for. My mother she is a truly amazing woman that has been through so much heartache but stood tall throuh it all and come out with hope and she is a true inspiration.  
						</li>
					<h2>	
						What are my aspirations for the future?
					</h2>	
						<li>
							I hope to make people aware of the torture being done to Mustangs by Helicoptor Roundups. I hope to be an advocate to all animals being beaten, neglected, and tortured, that need a voice. Just because they can't speak human language does not mean they do not have spirits and they deserve to be treated with respect.   
						</li>
					<h2>
						What are my interest?
					</h2>
						<li>
							My interest are simple, I love doing RODEOS but all things with animals make my heart smile.
						</li>
						<li>
							All things big and small furry and scaly! I live to take care animals and make sure they have a voice.
						</li>
						<li>
							I love gardening, and digging in the dirt, it's rewarding to get my own veggies from the ground instead a shelf where pesticides have been sprayed on them.
						</li>
