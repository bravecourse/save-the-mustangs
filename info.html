          <p class="text-white-50">* March 3,2022 CISION PR Newswire aired a polling of American voters that found the Helicopter Roundups Inhumane and were shocked at the amount of taxpayers money that has gone into them.<a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/3-out-of-4-americans-oppose-inhumane-helicopter-roundups-of-wild-horses-301494843.html">LINK</a>* I think we can all agree the Bureau of Land Management has slaughtered enough Wild Horses and Burros and taken enough taxpayers money to do it "53.2 million dollars since 2006".<a href="https://americanwildhorsecampaign.org/media/report-us-public-paying-hundreds-millions-fund-wild-horse-roundups">LINK</a>
          </p>
            <p class="text-white-50">* I hope one day Americans will band together like a herd of free Mustangs and see the Beauty of fighting together instead fighting against each other. Then we can save these Iconic Animals, these legends that so few know about but so many long to see once in there lifetime.
            </p>
             <p class="text-white-50">* BLM has been giving people $1,000 to take mustangs and $800 to take Burros but records show<a href="https://www.eenews.net/articles/documents-show-blm-wild-horses-sold-to-slaughter-advocates-say/">LINK</a> and witnesses verify that more often then not these horses end up at auctions going to Slaughter houses for the Canadian and Mexican Meat trade Pipeline.<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/15/us/wild-horses-adoptions-slaughter.html">LINK</a></p> 
            <p class="text-white-50">* This is just one of the many things that the American Wild Horse Campaign has been able to open our eyes to,. The holding facilities that the BLM swears are wonderful, are not suitable at all in fact some are borderline falling down and understaffed, with incompetent people caring for the animals. People need to start listening and paying attention. Just one more voice than yesterday makes a difference than the day before, imagine the difference hundreds or thousands of voices can make and your voice could be one of them!<a href="https://americanwildhorsecampaign.org/media/internal-reports-document-widespread-animal-welfare-violations-federal-wild-horse-holding">LINK</a></p>

            <h5 class="text-white-50">American Wild Horse Campaign has had many successes over the years but they need YOUR help to continue to fight the Bureau of Land Management against the cruel treatment of Wild Horses and Burros. <a href="https://americanwildhorsecampaign.org/media/report-us-public-paying-hundreds-millions-fund-wild-horse-roundups">LINK</a></h5>

Right now is the worst time to do it when mares are pregnant, or running with their young foals!

               <div class="text-white">* A few years ago Bureau of Land Management SHOT and killed horses that they said were to far gone to load on a trailer or "Humanely Euthanize". That is disgusting and for a government agency to think that it is all right to gun done American Wild Horses after a Law states they will be protected. What else are they capable of doing.<a href="https://www.8newsnow.com/news/local-news/i-team-blm-says-shooting-deaths-of-wild-horses-was-humane-euthanasia">There are graphic images in this news story!</a>* Why isn't the Bureau of Land Management being held accountable for any of their actions? There needs to be more accountability for what they are doing and these legends need to be taken care of.
                <p class="mb-0 text-white-20">Bureau of Land Management should be held accountable for the inhumane treatment after the Round Ups also. The deadly outbreak in just one holding facility is enough to prove they have no time to vaccine them or worm them or just don't care to because lets face it they DO NOT care what happens to these Amazing animals as long as they are no longer FREE.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3ex0FxWzxc">This may be hard to watch.</a></p>They don't take care of the needs of these animals once they are taken out of the wild and thrown into an over-crowded holding pen!

                <h5 class="text-white">On August 27, 2022 there was another disease outbreak at another BLM holding facility this one in Colorado. Animal rights advocates are exploring a lawsuit around the failure to vaccinate and standards of care at holding facilities. Gov. Jared Polis on Thursday weighed in, directing state agricultural and veterinary officials “to re-engage” with the BLM “to review the situation and evaluate what can be done” to avoid future deaths in captivity. “I am deeply concerned about the tragic death of these iconic animals,” Polis said. “We have long advocated for the health, safety, and well being of Colorado’s wild horses, and will continue to do so as we seek a humane future for our mustangs.”Even with vaccinations, eleven horses died since March at the BLM holding facility in Wyoming where an outbreak of “strangles” (streptococcus equi) has infected roughly half the 2,750 captive horses, that is an astonishing number 1,400 horses.<a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2022/05/12/wild-horses-die-unvaccinated-blm/">LINK</a>
