            <h5><p class="text-white-50">The horses on this page may not be mustangs, but for me this put a spin on the cruelty the Bureau of Land Management is doing to one-eyed and blind Wild Horses and Burros and the ones that have no eyes at all. These legends have been living on the land for years some of them are 20 years old that they have killed, and are killing. If they lived that long free they deserve to live wild and free forever or have someone love them for the rest of their lives instead of being killed by the Bureau of Land Management! But in the case of our free Wild horses with missing eyes or that are blind the Bureau of Land Management killed them or will kill them if they round them up with a Helicopter during their Round Ups! Why I ask again is it because they think no one would adopt them? Or they think they aren't pretty enough, or good enough? Why don't they deserve to live like these free horses in the following stories?
            </h5>  
            </p>
            <p class="text-white-50">* This is the story of Ward a Blind 21 year old horse that Inspires people everywhere. Another horse that BLM would have euthanized if they lived free in the wild.<a href="https://www.ocalagazette.com/blind-horse-inspires-others-to-keep-striving/">LINK</a></p>

            <p class="text-white-50">Meet Endo the the horse with no eyes but he does trail-riding, jumping and his story will warm your heart. His owner picked him when he was a baby she was young and they grew together. This is his story if he were a mustang he would have been euthanized by the Bureau of Land Management.<a href="https:///www.thoroughbreddailynews.com/jumping-blindly-into-uncharted-territory">LINK</a></p>

           <div class="container"> This isn't a mustang but this is how amazing horses with no eyes, one eye, and blind horses can be. Bureau of Land Management is killing Wild Horses and Burros for no reason other than, they don't believe that they have a reason to live! I think this video shows different I think the bond we can create with any Legend is priceless if they are going to take it off the land they can't be allowed to slaughter them. This is Alizee and she has no eyes, yes that is right not blind not one eyed, NO EYES and she is amazing.Please watch her amazing story.

               <div class="text-white">Why isn't the Bureau of Land Management being questioned about the reasoning behind why they are euthanizing all these Wild Horses and Burros. Horses and Burros with sway backs that depending on the slope, and severity don't even bother them. Many horses are raced, jumped, and ridden daily that have sway backs. One-eyed horses, blind horses, horses with puncture wounds probably caused by the debris from the Helicopters they are using, horses with hoof issues that with farrier work if handled properly can be corrected and there are thousands of volunteers that would do corrective hoof care to keep these Wild creatures alive. It's heart breaking, and disgusting that the Bureau of Land Management has been allowed to do this when there has been a LAW in place for 50 years "PROTECTING" these amazing animals. Help us give them a voice! The WORST part is it could all be stopped if We BANNED Helicopter Round Ups!
